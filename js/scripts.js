//Custom Js

/* Statically Typed (C++ , C+ , Java)
int number = 10;
number = "a"; Causes Error obviously

Dynamically Typed (Javascript, Python, Ruby)
let number = 10;
number = "a"; // No Error - determines variable type at runtime
Math.round(number) // Would then cause an error since the number is now a string
